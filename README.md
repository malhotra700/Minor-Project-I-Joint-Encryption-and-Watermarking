# Minor-Project-I-Joint-Encryption-and-Watermarking
Proposed and Implemented a Joint Encryption and Watermarking Scheme for Security of Medical Images and EPR data using **AES-CTR, DWT, Arnold Transform and PN Sequence.** The results show good performance in terms of imperceptibility (**max PSNR=76.12 dB**), robustness (**avg NC=0.86**) and security (**UACI=36.7%**).
